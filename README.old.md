## Why

                            Problems
From what we gathered from administering questionnaires to teachers, students and managers, we can conclude in few sentences:
- Lack of means to pay school fees
- Poor quality of education at all levels (generally senior and junior high school).
- Lack of E-learning system, Evaluating and Lesson Note Content Delivery Process
- Poor Internet quality to learn
- Lack of student Guidance (generally young ones) on what they want to do in the future
- Students teaching themselves and how they can use their phones and laptops for good purpose 
- Lack of investment and bad management of funds and no traceability of their fund 
- Parents contribution and evaluation 
- Lack of ways to exchange new technologies for professional sector

                            TARGET AND SOLUTIONS

We want to create an interactive platform (Web app and Mobile app) where student can teach themselves, teachers and mentors can assist them with learning materials and guidance, also to create a connected Africa for job opportunities and investment in Education sector.
For that we want to create a Web APP and mobile app to deliver content to students, teachers, mentors, investors, parents and professional sectors.
 - To solve the issue of Internet connection, all courses will have an offline access, so when the student or user join a course, all the content will be available offline through our app and a Realtime synchronization when online.

- And we also want be able to provide private courses to students and professional courses to professional sector.
- Look for investors and help them to invest in education through our platform.
- for parents who don't have means to send their children to schools we will help them with lower cost and connect them to investors.
- Donation collection to invest in education purpose 
- Investors can invest through our platform, track and manage their investment, have Real-time update and report
Everything will be design for students to teach themselves.
